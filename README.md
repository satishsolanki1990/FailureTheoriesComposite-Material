# Implemention of Failure Theories for Composite Material


## Motivation:
I want to build my own database and software, which I can use in 
research. It can be handy for quick decision and material selection.

## Background:
It is very important to decide the safety of materials under certain
loading condition. Therefore the failure theories are used to determine whether the component is safe under certain
stress state or not. 
The Composite Materials are orthotropic in nature and its strength depends on fiber orientation and
material type. There are 4 failure theories:

1. The Maximum Stress
2. The Maximum Strain
3. Tsai-Hill Failure Criteria
4. Tsai-Wu failure Criteria

If analysis is performed manually, due to complex and lengthy calculations are involved
that takes time and effort. By making a Stand-alone executable program will reduce this time, improve accuracy, reliability and help in quick decision on material
selection.
